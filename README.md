# RVRentalWebsite

Tour Explorer is an online RV Rentals website made for users to browse, search and make reservations for our RV rental services.
Users can browse different kinds of cars without register/login, or they can choose to register/login to make an order or add their favorite cars to the wish list. Users can also search for a specific name or a specific category of the car on our website.
Of course, users can remove item from their wish list at any time they want on the Wishlist page. 
They can also view the order history when they click their account icon/name.
We also have an admin account which allows admin to view all the cars, add a new car, edit the car information, and soft delete a car from the website by changing its count to 0. When admin soft deletes a car, users cannot see the car on the website anymore, but admin still can see and edit it. So the admin can recover the soft deleted car at any time if he/she wants users to see it again.
